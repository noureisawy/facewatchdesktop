Quick Document for the Whole Project

The Facewatch project is a health monitoring system that utilizes facial recognition and machine learning algorithms to detect and predict various health conditions. The project consists of a backend server and a desktop application.

The backend server is responsible for accepting shared images from the user and updating the deep learning models with the new data. It uses version control to track changes in the model weights and allows for efficient model updates.

The desktop application allows users to capture images, view reports, and update their profile information. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the health monitoring system.

The project aims to provide accurate predictions for the level of alertness, emotions, and potential medical diseases using facial recognition and machine learning techniques. The system continuously analyzes and tracks these factors, providing valuable insights into users' well-being and overall health status.

Future work for the project includes expanding the dataset for disease predictions, improving facial expression analysis under challenging conditions, and offering personalized health insights to users based on their specific health profile and historical data.
